# Debug: Refresh Issue with Registration Result

## Problem
When refreshing the page on the complete step, `registrationResult` is lost, causing incomplete setup information.

## Debug Steps Added

### 1. Console Logging
Added debug logging to track `registrationResult` through the system:

```typescript
// In setup-wizard.tsx
console.log('SetupWizard: Stored registration result', result);

// In use-setup-wizard-state.ts
console.log('Hook: Loaded registrationResult from localStorage', loaded);
console.log('Hook: Saved registrationResult to localStorage', registrationResult);

// In complete-step.tsx
console.log('CompleteStep: registrationResult', registrationResult);
```

### 2. Fixed Order of Operations
**Problem**: `clearSetupWizardState()` was called immediately after setting `registrationResult`, clearing it from localStorage.

**Solution**: Removed the immediate call to `clearSetupWizardState()` in `handleSubmit`.

### 3. Enhanced clearSetupWizardState
**Problem**: `clearSetupWizardState()` was clearing all localStorage keys, including `registrationResult`.

**Solution**: Modified to preserve `registrationResult` when on the complete step:

```typescript
const clearSetupWizardState = useCallback(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    try {
      // Don't clear registration result if we're on the complete step
      const keysToClear = Object.values(STORAGE_KEYS).filter(key => 
        key !== STORAGE_KEYS.REGISTRATION_RESULT || currentStep !== 'complete'
      );
      
      keysToClear.forEach(key => {
        localStorage.removeItem(key);
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Failed to clear localStorage:', error);
    }
  }
}, [currentStep]);
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Complete Setup**: Go through the entire setup process
2. **Check Console**: Verify registration result is stored
3. **Refresh Page**: Refresh on complete step
4. **Check Console**: Verify registration result is loaded
5. **Verify UI**: Check that system information is displayed
6. **Download Info**: Verify complete information in JSON

## Expected Console Output

### After Registration:
```
SetupWizard: Stored registration result {organization: {...}, credentials: {...}}
Hook: Saved registrationResult to localStorage {organization: {...}, credentials: {...}}
CompleteStep: registrationResult {organization: {...}, credentials: {...}}
```

### After Refresh:
```
Hook: Loaded registrationResult from localStorage {organization: {...}, credentials: {...}}
CompleteStep: registrationResult {organization: {...}, credentials: {...}}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If registrationResult is null after refresh:
1. Check if localStorage is working
2. Check if the key is being saved correctly
3. Check if clearSetupWizardState is being called unexpectedly
4. Check if there are any errors in the console

### If registrationResult is saved but not loaded:
1. Check the localStorage key name
2. Check if JSON parsing is working
3. Check if there are any errors in loadFromStorage

### If registrationResult is cleared immediately:
1. Check if clearSetupWizardState is called too early
2. Check if the currentStep check is working correctly
3. Check if the filter logic is correct
